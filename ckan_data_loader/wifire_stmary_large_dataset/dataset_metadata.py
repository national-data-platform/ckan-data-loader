    "BurnPro3D is designed for use in fire mitigation by land managers and burn bosses to "
    "prioritize land for treatment, and plan and conduct prescribed burns. The platform is "
    "powered by the next generation WIFIRE Data and Model Commons. It provides diverse users "
    "a common ground for understanding risks and tradeoffs related to prescribed burns through "
    "detailed models of vegetation and fire behavior.\n\n"
    "BurnPro3D uses a coupled fire/atmosphere model to capture the interaction between "
    "user-defined complex ignition patterns and environmental conditions. With support "
    "from the National Science Foundation, the BurnPro3D team is developing emerging "
    "AI techniques to transform the characterization of the fire environment, "
    "including dynamic site-specific three-dimensional fuels and winds."

    "notes": """This dataset is an ensemble of prescribed fire simulations generated by the QUIC-Fire coupled 
    fire-atmospheric modeling tool. Each simulation run is represented by a zarr file, containing the outputs created 
    by QUIC-Fire through the BurnPro3D web interface. To model a burn, users upload the polygon for their burn unit 
    and BurnPro3D uses a 3D fuels model for that location created by FastFuels and an ignition file with a 
    user-defined ignition pattern created in DripTorch. Those files are included here as well. In addition, 
    users define the environmental conditions they would like to model in terms of fuel moisture, wind direction and 
    wind speed. The relevant information about the versions used of BurnPro3D, QUIF-Fire, FastFuels and DripTorch are 
    included in the metadata, along with both presets defined by BP3D and user-defined model inputs.

### Varying Parameters:
wind_speed: 3 unique values  
wind_direction: 3 unique values  
surface_moisture: 4 unique values  
canopy_moisture: 2 unique values

### Total: 72 simulation runs.
